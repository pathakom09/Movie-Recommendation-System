**Movie Recommendation System** üçø
_A personalized movie recommendation platform built with love and powered by machine learning_

üìñ Description
---------------
The Movie Recommendation System is a web-based application designed to provide users with personalized movie recommendations based on their preferences. The system utilizes a combination of natural language processing, collaborative filtering, and content-based filtering to suggest movies that users are likely to enjoy. With a user-friendly interface and a vast database of movies, this platform aims to revolutionize the way people discover new movies and TV shows.

The system is built using a range of technologies, including Python, Streamlit, and Bokeh, to create a seamless and interactive user experience. The application allows users to search for movies, view recommendations, and even access external links to watch their favorite films. With its robust architecture and intuitive design, the Movie Recommendation System is an ideal solution for movie enthusiasts and casual viewers alike.

The project is divided into several components, each responsible for a specific function. The `popular.py` file contains the main application logic, while the `movie-web.html` file handles the frontend and user interface. The `app ¬∑ Streamlit.html` and `popular ¬∑ Streamlit.html` files are generated by Streamlit and provide a interactive interface for the application. The `Untitled.py` file contains experimental code for content-based filtering and is not currently used in the production version of the application.
